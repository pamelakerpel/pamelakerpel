# Hey

My name is Pâmela Kerpel.  

I like to watch movies and series, listen to music, read, take pictures, run and travel. 

I study in the 8th edition of the Starter Full Stack Web Developer Program.

I work in the commercial team at Growdev.

I haven't defined my favorite programming language yet, it would be like a mother having to choose just one of her children.

Currently I'm listening to font end and back end and some languages out of curiosity for example: React Js and React Native.
