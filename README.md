# Hey 👋🏻

My name is Pâmela Kerpel 👩🏻‍💻🇧🇷

I like to watch movies and series 💻  listen to music 🎧 read 📖 take pictures 📷 run 🏃🏻‍♀️  and travel 🌍  

I study in the 8th edition of the Starter Full Stack Web Developer Program 👩🏻‍🎓 

I work in the commercial team at Growdev 📲

I haven't defined my favorite programming language yet, it would be like a mother having to choose just one of her children 👩🏻‍🚀  

Currently I'm listening to font end and back end and some languages out of curiosity for example: React Js and React Native 🖥

### 🚀 "May the force be with you - Star Wars" ✨
